# forceCRC32
A JavaScript version of Nayuki Minase's CRC-32 Forcer

Credit goes to [Nayuki Mianse] (http://www.nayuki.io/) for her [excelent article] (http://www.nayuki.io/page/forcing-a-files-crc-to-any-value)
on how to force a particular CRC-32 code by manipulating four bytes in the target file. Nayuki provides Python and Java example
code in her article. So, I thought I'd contribute a NodeJS JavaScript version for the curious. As an aside, it is really nice to
see her [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/) solutions on her [Github] (https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions).
